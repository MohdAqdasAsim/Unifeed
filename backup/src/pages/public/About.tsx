        Unifeed is a unified platform that helps teams turn scattered user
        feedback into meaningful product insights. Whether it’s from app
        reviews, social media, or customer surveys — we bring all that noise
        together, clean it up, and help you discover what users truly care
        about.

            Why Unifeed?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
            Most feedback tools focus on collection. Unifeed focuses on
            understanding. We categorize, prioritize, and visualize feedback so
            product decisions can be made with clarity — not guesswork.
